## â˜… Playlist

For starts we should be able to play the local song `mariobros.mp3`.

As an added feature instead of playing only a local file we want to be able to fetch a playlist from a remote server.

To get the list of songs do a request to `GET /api/songs`

Show the list of songs, artist name, cover image and genre.

I want to be able to play load into my player any song from the list.
